## How it works

TODO

## Setup

- First, install ipfs. When running the app, run the daemon with pubsub enabled

    ``` bash
        ipfs daemon --enable-pubsub-experiment
    ```

- navigate to the root directory and execute

    ``` bash
        npm install
    ```

    and then

    ``` bash
        npm start
    ```

- by default, the API will run on port 3000.
